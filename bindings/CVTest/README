Cocoa bindings docs are a bit thin on a lot of topics.  "Handles Content As Compound Value" is definitely one of those. The most information I was ever able to find in the Apple docs came from this diagram: 

http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/Concepts/MessageFlow.html

This is a project that illustrates how this feature works.

The main model object CVModel, is fully mutable, and therefore its controller doesn't need to set  "Handles Content As Compound Value".  Each individual key can be written directly, *at that level*.

I'm also sorta double-tasking the compound value feature with ValueTransformers to allow bindings on scalar structures (NSSize, NSPoint).

I'll elaborate on this description later if necessary.
